## Phaser Library Contributions

To develop on the library, clone or fork it. [GitHub repo](https://github.com/cmr624/cm-phaser-library.git)

Install `cd path/to/cm-phaser-library && npm i` and begin developing!

To contribute:

1. `git checkout -b <new branch name>`
2. Make changes or add content to any of the code in the `src` folder.
3. `git add .`
4. `git commit -m "adding content"`
5. `git push`
6. Once the changes should be merged to master, create a pull request on GitHub and ask for (@cmr624) to review it.

## Documentation Contributions

This documentation is open source and is built using a Gatsby starter for a markdown website.

It has a bunch of awesome features and lets us write blogs or regular documentation in markdown and publish easily and quickly. I also added syntax highlighting with PrismJS for Javascript syntax highlighting in code blocks.
